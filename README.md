## How to Play Memory Game 

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

On each turn:
* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

### Special Features
* The game features a timer to keep track of how long it takes to win and reports time on win screen.
* The player starts out with a three star rating -- but the rating drops the more moves it take to complete the game.
* When the game ends, a pop-up appears with the elapsed time, final stars rating and a restart button.
